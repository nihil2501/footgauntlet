Max `Brod` was the best friend of Franz Kafka. His literary stature is lesser,

> The quiet Kafka "would have been... hard to notice... even his elegant,
> usually dark-blue, suits were inconspicuous and reserved like him. At that
> time, however, something seems to have attracted him to me, he was more open
> than usual, filling the endless walk home by disagreeing strongly with my all
> too rough formulations."
